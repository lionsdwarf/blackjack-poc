## blackjack-poc
### Single-player blackjack game in JS, HTML, and CSS


#### Implementation:

- Dealer hits on soft 17
- Player cannot split cards
- Single deck, shuffled every six rounds (Deal button indicates when shuffle occurs)
- Round ends if dealer is dealt blackjack--player does not get a turn on initial deal


#### Running the Build:

after `npm install`...

`npm run build` compiles static js build

`npm run watch` runs file watch & re-compiles on save

There is no dev server--reference index.html directly in browser.
